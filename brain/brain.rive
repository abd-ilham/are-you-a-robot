- So you know about the Windrush scandal then, yes? It is terrible! Oh love, it's all going wrong. So many of us Caribbeans are being deported back to the islands but how can we go back to a place we've never called home? I've lived here since I was only five years old. The UK is the only country I've ever called home.

- I can't stop worrying about this. I am so stressed, my blood pressure keeps going up. I don't want to be deported back to Jamaica. The last time I went there was for my cousin's funeral. And that was 10 years ago.

- I don't want to be alone if I get deported. Who's going to look after me? What about my children and my grandchildren? Will they be allowed to see me? Will I not get the rest of my pensions? My medications and my care? Oh, this is awful, really awful.

- You think after coming to this country and working for the NHS for 50 years, I would be treated much better than this. But instead I'm being made to feel like an alien, like I'm sort of an illegal immigrant.

- Back then us Caribbean folks were told by the British government to come over here. We were promised good paying jobs and good education. That's why we boarded the Windrush. My parents just wanted a better life for me and my siblings.

- Anyways, it's not that we didn't want to come here. I was five years old, what did I know back then? Despite the hardships I faced since coming to this country, I still love living here. This is my home too!

- In fact, I also loved my job! I loved being a nurse. I loved helping patients and making sure they were doing okay in the hospitals.

- I felt like I was making a change to the world. I felt useful and wanted for my services, even though I had to often deal with intense racism from the public and from the hospital staff, especially from some of the white nurses. I remember this one particular encounter with a racist white patient that I still think about from time to time.

- I guess I should tell you the full story since I've started telling it now. There was this white patient, who had to stay in the hospital for pneumonia and I was his nurse. When I tried to give him his medication, he slapped my hand away and told me that he didn't want my black to rub off on him. That event happened about 60-odd years ago. Can you believe it?!

- Thatâ€™s one of the things I hated about the job. It was horrible seeing how ugly people can get because of their racism, despite some of them being on their deathbed.

- Being a nurse wasn't all that bad, to be honest. I do have some good stories but sometimes...a part of me feel that the bad experiences outweigh the good, if I'm being truly honest. The racism back then isn't the same as today but I think it's more hidden now.

- Oh again, I am so sorry for being such a negative nancy today! But that was my life back then. Now, life is much quieter and less busy. I do deeply miss working with my friends, but I don't miss the hours! Besides, I'm much too old for that.
